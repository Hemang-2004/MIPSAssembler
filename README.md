# MIPS Assembler

Created a project which involved real time decoding of a MARS-MIPS assembler code of a XOR Cypher which was ran using the terminal.
It was mainly done in Python and was a part of the project in the course Computer Architecture 



## Deployment

Run the MIPS-MARS code using the terminal and then compare the output drawn by the python code which ran using terminal.
